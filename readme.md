<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![kakshya CMS][product-screenshot]](#)
![images/Screenshot1.png](images/Screenshot1.png)

**Kakshya RMS** is a result management system app written in Java to understand the usage of various Java libraries and concepts.
Here's why:
* Every topic and concept is attempted to be implemented in the most practical way.
* This should help you to understand the concepts and learn the best way to implement them. :smile:

Thi is still a work in progress and you can help us by contributing to the project.


<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



### Built With

The goal of the project was to cover almost/all the concepts and libraries of Java included in the curriculum of 'Programming in Java' class. Also, I have tried to avoid external libraries and frameworks.

* [IntelliJ Idea Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
* [Open Jdk 17 (Downloaded by from Intellij itself)](https://openjdk.java.net/install/)
* [JavaFx](https://openjfx.io/)
* Awt
* Swing
* [JDBC](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/index.html)
* Socket
* [MySql with Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
